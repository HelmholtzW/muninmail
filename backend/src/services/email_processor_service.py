    üîç ASYNCIO CORE CONCEPT: Event Loop and Concurrency
    This is where asyncio magic begins! We're going to run two tasks concurrently:
    1. Email fetcher (runs every few minutes)
    2. Email processor (runs continuously)

    Key Learning Points:
    - asyncio.gather() starts both tasks simultaneously
    - Both tasks share the same thread but yield control at 'await' points
    - This is perfect for I/O-bound work like ours (database, network, AI APIs)
