  - [x] RESTful API endpoints for email operations
  - [x] Email fetching, sending, and processing
- [x] Minimal Next.js Frontend:
  - [x] Modern React-based UI with shadcn/ui components
  - [x] Email inbox, compose, and management interfaces

### Phase 2: Local AI Integration
**Status: Core AI features implemented**

- [x] AI Skills Implementation:
  - [x] Email summarization (`summarize_email.py`)
  - [x] Todo extraction (`extract_todos.py`) 
  - [x] Flag detection and tagging (`get_flags.py`)
- [x] Model Integration:
  - [x] Connected to Cerebras API for AI processing
  - [x] Structured JSON responses for all AI operations

### üöß Phase 3: Database Migration (SQLite Transition)
**Current Priority: Simplify data layer**

- [ ] **Replace PostgreSQL with SQLite**:
  - [ ] Migrate `database.py` to use SQLite with AsyncIO
  - [ ] Update `db_models.py` for SQLite compatibility
  - [ ] Create migration scripts from current PostgreSQL schema
- [ ] **Simplify Data Operations**:
  - [ ] Remove PostgreSQL-specific features
  - [ ] Optimize for single-user, local storage
  - [ ] Implement proper SQLite WAL mode for concurrent access

### üöß Phase 4: Background Processing Modernization
**Current Priority: Replace Celery infrastructure**

- [ ] **Replace Celery with AsyncIO**:
  - [ ] Migrate `email_tasks.py` to pure asyncio queues
  - [ ] Implement simple task scheduling with `asyncio.create_task()`
  - [ ] Remove Redis dependency entirely
- [ ] **Streamlined Processing Pipeline**:
  - [ ] Direct email ingestion without message broker
  - [ ] In-memory task queues for AI processing
  - [ ] Background email sync with configurable intervals

### üîÑ Phase 5: Architecture Simplification
**Status: Planning**

- [ ] **Remove Docker Dependencies**:
  - [ ] Create standalone Python application
  - [ ] Bundle all dependencies with the application
  - [ ] Implement configuration file-based setup (no environment variables)
- [ ] **Self-Contained Email Storage**:
  - [ ] Local SQLite database in user's app data directory
  - [ ] Email attachments stored in local file system
  - [ ] Configurable storage limits and cleanup

### üîÑ Phase 6: Enhanced Local AI Pipeline
**Status: To be refined**

- [ ] **Improved AI Features**:
  - [ ] Add custom flag definitions
  - [ ] Create proper MuninAgent with control over the entire client
  - [ ] Meeting/calendar integration extraction

- [ ] **Improve UI/UX**:
  - [ ] Add Drafts, Sent, Deleted, etc. folders
  - [ ] Expose custom flag definition
  - [ ] Add calendar view
  - [ ] etc.


### üí∞ Phase 7: Moentization
**Status: Setting up payment logic**

- [ ] **Adding Credit Logic***:
  - [ ] Setting up tracking for user credits

- [ ] **Adding Payments**:
  - [ ] Integrating Strip to buy more credits

### üîÑ Phase 8: Native Mac Application Framework
**Status: Planning for final stage**

- [ ] **Electron/Tauri Integration**:
  - [ ] Choose between Electron and Tauri for native app wrapper
  - [ ] Bundle Next.js frontend and FastAPI backend
  - [ ] Implement native Mac system integration (notifications, menu bar)
- [ ] **Application Architecture**:
  - [ ] Single executable with embedded web server
  - [ ] Native file dialogs and system integrations
  - [ ] Mac-specific features (Touch Bar, shortcuts)

### üéØ Phase 9: .dmg Distribution Preparation
**Status: Final goal**

- [ ] **Build System**:
  - [ ] Create automated build pipeline for Mac
  - [ ] Code signing and notarization for Mac App Store compatibility
  - [ ] .dmg packaging with proper installer UX
- [ ] **Native Features**:
  - [ ] Mac keychain integration for email credentials
  - [ ] System preferences integration
  - [ ] Auto-update mechanism
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**:
  - [ ] Minimize memory footprint
  - [ ] Optimize startup time
  - [ ] Background processing without blocking UI

### üîí Phase 10: Security & Privacy (Ongoing)
**Status: Continuous**

- [ ] **Local Data Security**:
  - [ ] SQLite database encryption
  - [ ] Secure credential storage in Mac Keychain
  - [ ] No cloud data transmission (except AI API calls)
- [ ] **Privacy Compliance**:
  - [ ] Minimal data collection
  - [ ] User control over AI processing
  - [ ] Clear privacy policy for AI feature usage
