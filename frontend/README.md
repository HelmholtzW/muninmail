# Frontend

This is the frontend for the Cerebras Hackathon project, built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) with your browser to see the result.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode using Turbopack on port 9002.
Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run genkit:dev`

Starts the Genkit development server.

### `npm run genkit:watch`

### `npm run build`
